PLAN
UI
add buttons and make it look clean
look at finding a way to push graph resultant into canvas - if not possible just let the pop up exist
-look into combo box more to find way to add objects and select using an accessor/getter

MODEL
implement functions to read CSV
implement function to generate graph - look at matplotlib

CONTROLLER - most likely a class that contains both UI and model linked as variable objects
link button to model

FINISHED
add setters and getters for all the stuff cause right now its ugly and poor oop

update x and y axis based on combobox - need to start actually making the button handler work for unique buttons

additional params?
visually show the changing value of the slider to make it easier for user
-maybe even a manual typing of desired value - probably not implementing for awhile
-real tryhard = live visualisation of the line width - scrap that its not happening

why are the dots not added from lowest val to highest val? - fixed
error handling zzzzzzzzzzz - done
kinda want to make terminal more readable so rename params to their actual parameters - done
combobox text update not as easy as slider update - find solution that is considered "elegant" - close enough
customize name of axis - may have to change existing logic as it kinda relies on the key name
add title to graph
manually typing params - as far as i want to go with it

optimize code to look nicer
-mainly just think of utilizing my mass config mutator instead of the separate methods for x/y overloads and title setting
-decided to just go with mass config mutator in my controller and then using setters


TO DO

after that i think the projects initial scope is compeleted (started 17/12/23 - 22/12/23 est finish)
-i believe initial scope of project has now been finished - 22/12/23 (12:46pm)





non-urgent




out of scope
add additional sub plots
have a combobox for existing subplots
remove lines
